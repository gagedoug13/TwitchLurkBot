Logic for how the program is going to run - 

Connection to DB is established
find streamer and create new stream object 

INTERVAL - runs once per minute
get streamer details
get screenshot
append screenshot to users stream object

------------------------------------------
socket ends

take data from stream object and create HTML file 
email that file to streamer's email address
